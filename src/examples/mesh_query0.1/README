mesh_query 0.1
Released into the public domain by Robert Bridson (rbridson@cs.ubc.ca)

(except for file predicates.cpp, which was released into the public domain by
Jonathan Shewchuk)

To build libmesh_query.a, simply type make.

The header file mesh_query.h provides a bare bones plain C API to check if
points lie inside or outside a watertight mesh or if a segment intersects an
arbitrary mesh (returning barycentric coordinates if so), using a simple
AABB tree for acceleration.
